            Hello! My name is Sukhman and I enjoy creating things that live on
            the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012
            when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out
            hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML &
            CSS!{" "}
            <span>
              Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an
              advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a
              student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building
              accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at
              Upstatement for a variety of clients.

              I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need
              to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.{" "}

              Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:
